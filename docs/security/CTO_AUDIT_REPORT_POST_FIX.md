## Section Details

### 1. Testing & QA — 5.5/10 (was 2.5)

**Improved:** 32 test files (was 3), ~349 test cases, Vitest 4 + Testing Library, strong utility tests (deal-scoring 100+ cases, SSRF 170+ cases), custom test utilities with providers.

**Still needs work:** No E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress), only 14/200+ components tested (~7%), no integration tests, no coverage thresholds in CI, admin flows untested.

### 2. Architecture — 6.2/10 (was 5.0)

**Improved:** 18 large files split into modular directories, all 49 routes use React.lazy() with chunk recovery, 8 vendor chunks, feature-based organization, barrel exports.

**Still needs work:** 10 files still >1000 lines, no API service layer (1,355 direct .from() calls), 832 any/unknown instances, cross-feature coupling, oversized contexts.

### 3. Code Quality — 7.0/10 (was 5.0)

**Improved:** ESLint 9 strict + TypeScript plugin, Prettier, EditorConfig, Husky pre-commit, 50+ dead objects removed from database.

**Still needs work:** max-warnings=50 (should be 0), no-explicit-any is "warn" not "error", no commitlint, no security ESLint plugin.

### 4. Infrastructure & DevOps — 6.3/10 (was 4.0)

**Improved:** 3 GitHub Actions workflows (CI/Deploy/Preview), Docker multi-stage with Nginx, Dependabot with grouping, PR template, .nvmrc.

**Still needs work:** Monitoring at 3/10 (no Sentry/APM/health checks), migrations not in CI, no rollback docs, no bundle size tracking, missing .dockerignore.

### 5. Documentation — 7.5/10 (was 3.0)

**Improved:** README (13 sections), CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE, DATABASE, DEPLOYMENT, API, SMOKE_TESTS, security audit reports.

**Still needs work:** No architecture diagrams, no "First PR" guide, no ADRs.

### 6. Security — 8.0/10 (was 4.0)

**Improved:** RLS hardening across 10 migrations, USING(true) policies removed, saved_listings + connection_requests got RLS (had NONE), is_internal_deal=false enforced, all 6 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs got auth guards, CORS fixed on all 118 functions, comprehensive sanitization, CSP headers, MFA enforcement.

**Still needs work:** Rate limiting primarily client-side, Lovable CORS patterns broad, DocuSeal trusted domains too permissive.

### 7. Performance — 6.5/10 (was 5.0)

**Improved:** React.lazy for Tiptap (362KB) and Mapbox (1.7MB), staleTime 15min, 8 vendor chunks, LazyImage with IntersectionObserver, debounce/throttle utilities, SELECT * replaced.

**Still needs work:** Zero React.memo usage on components, no virtual lists for large tables, no performance monitoring/budgets, admin tables will lag at 500+ rows.

### 8. Database — 7.3/10 (was 5.5)

**Improved:** 50+ dead objects removed, website NOT NULL + CHECK, soft-delete cascade trigger, delete_listing_cascade fixed for all 25+ dependent tables, 55 strategic indexes, RLS comprehensively hardened.

**Still needs work:** No created_by/updated_by tracking, no universal audit trigger, no data retention policy, audit logging at 6/10, GDPR deletion not verified.

### 9. Data Pipelines — 7.5/10 (was 5.5)

**Improved:** Email retry with exponential backoff (brevo-sender.ts), unified delivery tracking across 18+ functions, hardcoded emails externalized to env vars, shared CORS on all 118 functions, circuit breaker, stale item recovery, anti-hallucination validation, HMAC webhook verification.

**Still needs work:** No dead-letter queue, some functions use direct fetch instead of sendViaBervo(), no per-user rate limiting, no request body size limits.

### 10. Developer Experience — 7.5/10 (was 4.5)

**Improved:** Clear README, Docker dev environment, barrel exports, @/ path alias, VS Code extensions, ROUTES constant, query key factory, Supabase type helpers.

**Still needs work:** No component scaffolding scripts, no Sentry, no .vscode/settings.json, no onboarding guide, test coverage too low.
