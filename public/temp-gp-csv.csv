Connected,2/3/2026,Not Fit,,Restoration,Protegrity Restoration,"Will not sell to PE.  Had a bad experience.......Call Eric (727)244-4975. Region FL | 24/7 Restoration Company. 600+ 5 star reviews. | Business History: The company is a restoration business that has been in operation for at least three years and operates 100% remotely without a physical location. It serves only the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida. Its first three years in business all included significant revenue from storm work.

Ownership Details: The business is co-owned by the speaker and a silent partner named Jim. The partner is a retired franchise attorney who invested in the speaker. A General Manager and a team run the day-to-day operations, with the speaker working approximately 10 hours per week on the business.

Transaction Goals: The owner is adamantly opposed to selling to a private equity firm due to negative past experiences and would only consider selling to a private individual. A potential sale timeline is noted, as the owner mentions waiting until October to reach a five-year holding period, which would provide a capital gains tax advantage. The owner is not in a rush to sell.

Financial info: The company operates on a cash basis and is debt-free, owning all its equipment. It typically generates $4 million to $5 million in gross revenue annually. Two years ago, a storm led to a year with $6.5 million in revenue and $2 million to $3 million in EBITDA. Last year's EBITDA was over $1 million, possibly between $1.5 million and $2 million. The owner personally earns over $500,000 per year from the business.

M&A History: The company has been contacted by approximately 30 different private equity firms. It has been under Letter of Intent (LOI) twice. One significant experience was with Guardian, a company owned by the fund Alpine, which lasted four to five months. This process involved extensive forensic accounting, a request to switch from cash to accrual accounting, and ultimately resulted in the buyer halving their offer after removing storm-related revenue from EBITDA calculations. The owner discovered this buyer acquired a direct competitor during the process, leading to a strong distrust of PE firms.

Exit Reasoning: The owner does not state a clear or urgent reason for exiting. He indicates that the business runs efficiently on its own, he is not building it aggressively, and he is content with his income from it. The primary motivation mentioned for a future sale is a potential tax advantage after holding the business for five years. He also suggests he might keep the business for life. | Business History: The company is a restoration business that has been in operation for at least three years, serving the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida. The business is run 100% remotely with no physical location and has a General Manager and team that handle operations, allowing the owner to work about 10 hours per week.

Ownership Details: The business is co-owned by the speaker and a silent partner. The partner is a retired franchise attorney who previously owned a large number of Taco Bell and KFC franchises and invested in the speaker to start the business.

Transaction Goals: The owner is strongly against selling to a private equity firm due to negative past experiences, but would be open to a sale to a private individual or a family office. A potential sale would likely wait until after October of the current year to meet a five-year holding period for capital gains tax advantages.

Financial info: The company operates on a cash basis, is debt-free, and owns all its equipment. Gross revenue is typically between $4 million and $5 million annually. Two years ago, a storm helped generate $6.5 million in revenue with $2 to $3 million in EBITDA. Last year, EBITDA was at least $1 million, potentially up to $2 million. The owner's personal income from the business is over $500,000 per year.

M&A History: The company has received interest from approximately 30 different PE firms and has been under LOI twice. One LOI process with Guardian (an Alpine-owned company) lasted several months before the deal fell through. The valuation was cut in half after due diligence because the buyer excluded storm-related revenue, and the owner discovered the buyer was simultaneously acquiring a direct competitor.

Exit Reasoning: The owner does not have a strong motivation to sell, as the business runs itself efficiently and provides a good income. He expressed that he may keep the business for life. An exit is being considered opportunistically if the right type of buyer (a private individual) emerges after a five-year tax holding period is met. | Business History: The company is a restoration business that has been operating for at least three years. It is 100% remote with no physical location and services only the Tampa Bay area on the west coast of Florida. The business is run by a General Manager and a team, which allows the owner to work on it about 10 hours a week.

Ownership Details: The business is co-owned by the speaker and a silent partner named Jim. The partner is described as an older, retired franchise and tax attorney who previously owned a large number of Taco Bell and KFC franchises and has invested in multiple companies.

Transaction Goals: The owner is strongly against selling to private equity due to negative past experiences, but would consider selling to a private individual or a family office. A potential sale would likely be deferred until after October of the current year to meet a five-year holding period for capital gains tax advantages. The owner is not in a hurry to sell.

Two years ago, a storm helped generate $6.5 million in revenue with $2 to $3 million in EBITDA. Last year, the company's EBITDA was over $1 million, possibly between $1.5 million and $2 million. The owner personally makes over $500,000 a year from the business.

M&A History: The company has been approached by approximately 30 PE firms and has been under LOI twice. A recent experience with Guardian, a portfolio company of the PE firm Alpine, involved a four-to-five month LOI period. This process included forensic accounting, a request to switch from cash to accrual accounting, and ended with the buyer cutting the offer in half and acquiring a competitor instead.

Exit Reasoning: A clear reason for exiting is not stated. The owner seems content with the business, which he says runs itself and provides a good income for minimal time investment. He mentions having another main source of income from real estate. The discussion focuses more on his unwillingness to sell to private equity rather than a motivation to exit.",,Eric,,,"eric@protegrityrestoration.com

Hi there,

We work with leading roofing acquirers actively buying strong operators like {{Company}}. These groups bring growth capital, recruiting support, and purchasing leverage while keeping your brand intact.

Here's what they're focused on:

  *   Residential Services: $2M+ revenue, limited new construction
  *   Commercial/Mechanical Services: $10M+ revenue, no construction limits, union & non-union)

We can connect you directly with top acquirers in days with no cost or obligation. Would you be open to a short call?

Best,
Elliot

The owners invested one million dollars into a secondary business called Dynamic Innovation.

M&A History: The owners had a discussion with an unnamed party earlier in the year regarding a sale. About eight years ago, they considered a partnership with a Toyota dealership to relocate the business, but they backed out of the deal due to unfavorable terms regarding the new location's property access. The local market landscape is seeing many single shops selling out to MSOs like Gerber and Caliber.

Exit Reasoning: The owners, a husband and wife, are considering a sale because they are ready to retire. They have been running the business for 23 years and are tired of the 'rat race.' The husband is 63 and is experiencing the physical strain of the work, with his knees, shoulders, and hips 'going out'. | Business History: The business is an auto body and paint shop that has been operating for 23 years in Hattiesburg, MS. It was built on a one-acre lot behind the owners' home and is not in a commercial area, relying on word-of-mouth. The facility comprises two buildings of about 24,000 sq ft. A secondary business, Dynamic Innovation, was created with a $1 million investment for in-house calibrations and alignments. The company is Gold certified for most makes and models, is the only GSA certified shop in the area, and maintains relationships with local dealerships and government entities like the Sheriff's Department and Camp Shelby.

Ownership Details: The business is owned by the speaker and her husband.

Transaction Goals: The owners are exploring the possibility of bringing on a partner or selling part of the business. They have indicated they would sell everything, including the primary auto body business and the secondary business, Dynamic Innovation.

Financial info: Sales last year were approximately $2.96 million. Sales for the current year are projected to be around $2 million, which is noted as a significant drop attributed to internal employee issues and an industry-wide lull. Prior to the last year, the company had experienced consistent year-over-year growth. The business achieves a 30% to 40% margin on paint supplies and targets a 25% to 36% markup on parts.

M&A History: The owners had a discussion with an unnamed party earlier in the year about a potential sale. About eight years ago, they considered a partnership with a local Toyota dealership to relocate, but the deal did not proceed because the dealership's proposed terms were not favorable. They are aware of market consolidation, noting that competitors have sold to MSOs like Gerber and Caliber.

Exit Reasoning: The primary reason for selling is the owners' desire to retire. They have been running the business for 23 years and are tired of the 'rat race'. The husband, who is 63 years old, has been doing body work since he was a teenager and is experiencing physical ailments with his knees, shoulders, and hips. | Business History: The business has been operating for 23 years in Hattiesburg, MS. It was built behind the owners' house on a one-acre lot and is not on a commercial road frontage. The facilities consist of two buildings totaling approximately 24,000 square feet for the body shop and paint department. A secondary business, Dynamic Innovation, was established with a one-million-dollar investment for automotive calibrations and alignments and is on a separate lot. The company is Gold certified, certified for most vehicle makes and models, and is GSA certified, which brings in work from government entities. The business has primarily grown through word-of-mouth.

Ownership Details: The business is owned by the speaker and her husband. No other partners or shareholders were mentioned. They own both the primary auto body business and the secondary business, Dynamic Innovation.

Transaction Goals: The owners are exploring the possibility of bringing on a partner or selling a portion of the business. They also stated they would be willing to sell everything, including both the primary and secondary businesses. No specific valuation, desired price, or transaction timeline was mentioned.

Financial info: Revenue for the prior year was approximately $2.96 million. For the current year, revenue is projected to be around $2 million, which the owner describes as a 'huge hit' attributed to internal employee issues discovered early in the year. Prior to this recent dip, the business had grown every single year. The business achieves margins of 30-40% on paint supplies and a parts markup of 25-36%.

M&A History: The owners had a discussion with an unnamed party earlier in the year about their business. Eight years ago, they considered a potential partnership with a local Toyota dealership to relocate the business, but the deal was rejected due to unfavorable terms regarding the proposed land and property access.

Exit Reasoning: The owners are selling because they are ready to retire after being in business for 23 years. The husband is 63 and is experiencing physical health issues related to the long-term demands of the job, including problems with his knees, shoulders, and hips. The owners also expressed they are 'tired of the rat race'. | Business History: The business is an auto collision shop that has been operating for 23 years in Hattiesburg, MS. It was built behind the owners' house on a one-acre lot and is not in a commercial area. The facility includes two buildings totaling approximately 24,000 square feet for the body shop and paint department. A secondary business, Dynamic Innovation, was established on a separate lot with a $1 million investment to handle in-house calibrations and alignments. The shop is Gold certified for most makes and models, is the only GSA certified shop in the area, and has relationships with local dealerships. The business operates primarily on word-of-mouth referrals.

Ownership Details: The business is owned by a husband and wife team. The husband has been doing body work since he was 14 or 15 years old.

Transaction Goals: The owners are considering bringing on a partner or selling part of the business. They have stated their intention is to sell everything, which includes the primary auto collision business and the secondary business, Dynamic Innovation.

Financial info: Revenue last year was approximately $2.96 million. Due to internal issues with employees and an industry-wide slowdown, revenue for the current year is projected to be around $2 million. Previously, the company had grown every year. The business achieves a 30% to 40% margin on paint supplies and targets a 25% to 36% markup on parts. The staff was reduced from 13 employees earlier in the year to a current team of two body techs, one painter, a parts person, a technician for calibrations/alignments, and the two owners.

M&A History: The owners had discussions with an unnamed party about a sale earlier in the current year. Several years ago, they considered a partnership with a Toyota dealership to move locations, but the deal did not proceed because the dealership would not provide road frontage and wanted to give them an access route through their parking lot.

Exit Reasoning: The owners are selling the business because they are ready to retire. The husband is 63 years old and is experiencing physical strain from the work, including issues with his knees, shoulders, and hips. They are generally 'tired of the rat race'.",,,,,richiescollisioncenter.com/,richiescollisioncenter.com/,601-550-4113,,"$2,000,000",,n/a,n/a,"29 Huckleberry Drive, Hattiesburg, MS 39402

"Intro to Buyer, Hard Sell - Region",,,Posted,Collision,Airpark Towing,"Reach out to Shore Capital or Search Funds

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the owner's father, who is still involved. The son, who is on the call, is also a key figure in running and growing the business. The son's brother works as a mechanic in one of the shops. The son started and owns Boomerang Car Rentals as a separate LLC.

Transaction Goals: The owner's father is hesitant to sell but would consider the 'right offer'. The owner himself would prefer to sell the entire company rather than bring on an equity partner for the main business, stating he would rather let someone else take it over completely. For an investment, he would prefer a debt-like structure. However, he is open to considering an equity investment specifically for his separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, which he believes could be very profitable with the right investment.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate about $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The company reports a low net income of approximately $10,000 to $20,000, which is attributed to a strategy of constantly reinvesting in the business (e.g., new trucks) and minimizing tax liability. The business does not participate in DRPs, instead focusing on high-quality repairs or totaling vehicles to charge insurance companies for storage on their two-acre lot, which costs about $20,000 per month in rent. They use PPG paint and perform ADAS work in-house, though they also outsource it when needed. A tax issue from 2020 recently caused a temporary financial setback but has been resolved.

M&A History: The owner was prompted to have this call because someone had recently reached out about a possible acquisition. He stated that the company had never considered selling prior to this inbound inquiry. At one point, they were offered a DRP arrangement with GEICO but turned it down.

Exit Reasoning: The primary motivation for considering a sale is the 'enormous amount of stress' from running the business. The owner states the company has become 'tougher and tougher to manage' due to its size and number of employees. He also notes his father is 'old school', which may imply a difference in management style for a company of its current scale. | Business History: The company was started by the owner's father in 1983 as a towing company. The son joined 19 years ago when there were three employees and has since grown the business. It now operates as a towing company with 18 trucks, a collision center named Air Park Auto Body, an auto repair shop called Airport Towing and Auto repair, and a two-acre towing and storage lot. The business holds a law enforcement contract with Montgomery County since 1987. The son also started a separate soccer complex for marketing and, two years ago, a car rental company LLC called Boomerang Car Rentals with 30 cars to service body shop customers.

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the owner's father. The son is heavily involved in operations and growth. The father is described as 'old school' and still part of the business. The son's brother runs the newer shop in Frederick County. The son started and owns Boomerang Car Rentals, which is a separate LLC.

Transaction Goals: The owner states his father would consider selling the entire company 'if the right offer comes'. The owner is open to a full sale of the main business but would not want to sell an equity position, preferring a debt-like structure for any investment. However, for his separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, he is open to considering an equity investor. The owner expressed a preference to 'let someone else completely take care of it' regarding the main business.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate approximately $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The owner states they do not show much net income, estimating it at maybe $10,000 to $20,000, due to a strategy of reinvesting in the business and minimizing taxes. The company has close to 48 employees. The main auto body shop is 15,000 sq ft, a separate storage lot is two acres with rent of about $20,000 per month, and a newer shop in another county is 10,000 sq ft. They do not participate in DRPs but do perform ADAS work in-house and use PPG paint.

M&A History: The owner stated that someone had recently reached out about a possible acquisition, which prompted him to have this call. He mentioned they had 'never, never even thought for a second' about selling prior to this. The business was once offered a DRP (Direct Repair Program) with GEICO but declined it.

Exit Reasoning: The owner is considering a sale due to the 'enormous amount of stress' involved in running the business. He finds the company, with its many employees and operational complexity, has become 'tougher and tougher to manage'. There also appears to be a difference in management style between the 'old school' father and the 'business savvy' son. | Business History: The company was started by the current owner's father in 1983 as a towing company with initially three employees. The owner joined 19 years ago and has since grown it to 48 employees. The business operates across two Maryland counties, Montgomery and Frederick, and holds a law enforcement contract for Montgomery County since 1987. It has expanded to include a collision center (Air Park Auto Body), a mechanical repair shop (Airport Towing and Auto Repair), a towing and storage lot, and a soccer complex (Air park soccerplex) used for marketing. Two years ago, the owner also founded a separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, which provides loaner cars to body shop customers.

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the owner's father and appears to be a family-owned operation, with the owner (son) and his brother also involved in management. The father is still involved but described as 'old school'. Boomerang Car Rentals is a separate LLC started and owned by the son. Specific ownership percentages are not mentioned.

Transaction Goals: The owner is not actively seeking a sale but is open to considering a full sale of the main company if the right offer comes. He expressed a preference to sell the entire company rather than a partial equity stake, stating he'd rather 'let someone else completely take care of it'. For the main business, he mentioned a preference for financing like a bank loan over selling equity. However, for his separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, he is open to selling an equity stake to an investor to help it grow.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate approximately $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The owner states they do not show much net income, estimating it around $10,000 to $20,000, as they strategically reinvest heavily in the business and manage for taxes. The owner did not provide an EBITDA figure. The main storage lot is two acres and costs about $20,000 a month in rent. The collision center is 15,000 sq ft, and a newer facility in Frederick is 10,000 sq ft. The company uses PPG paint and performs ADAS work in-house.

M&A History: The company has never actively pursued a sale. This conversation was initiated after an unsolicited party reached out about a potential acquisition. The owner states they have 'never even thought for a second' about selling prior to this. The company was offered a DRP relationship with GEICO at one point but declined the offer.

Exit Reasoning: The primary driver for considering a sale is the 'enormous amount of stress' and the increasing difficulty of managing a business of its current size with many employees. The owner feels it is becoming 'tougher and tougher to manage'. There is also a mention of the owner's father being 'old school,' which may hint at a desire for a change in management or strategy. | Business History: The company was started by the current owner's father in 1983 as a towing company. The son joined 19 years ago when there were three employees, and it has since grown to 48 employees. The business operates in Montgomery and Frederick counties in Maryland and consists of a towing operation with 18 trucks, a collision center (Air Park Auto Body), an auto repair shop (Airport Towing and Auto Repair), and a two-acre towing and storage lot. It holds a law enforcement contract with Montgomery County since 1987. The owner also started a branded soccer complex for marketing and, two years ago, a separate car rental company called Boomerang Car Rentals.

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the owner's father. The owner (son) and his father appear to be the primary operators. The owner's brother also works for the company as a mechanic. The car rental business, Boomerang Car Rentals, is a separate LLC started and owned by the son.

Transaction Goals: The owner's father does not want to sell but would consider it if the right offer comes. For the main group of businesses, the owner is primarily interested in a full sale of the entire company, stating he would rather let someone else take it over completely. He is resistant to selling an equity stake and would prefer a debt-like investment if not doing a full sale. However, for the separate car rental business, Boomerang Car Rentals, he is open to an equity investment.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate between $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The owner states the company nets very little, approximately $10,000 to $20,000, due to a strategy of constantly reinvesting in the business and minimizing tax obligations. The company has 48 employees and 18 tow trucks. The rent for their two-acre storage lot is about $20,000 per month. The separate car rental business has a fleet of 30 cars. The collision center is 15,000 square feet, and a new facility in Frederick is 10,000 square feet.

M&A History: The owner had never considered selling until an unnamed party recently reached out about a possible acquisition, which prompted this conversation. The company was previously offered a Direct Repair Program (DRP) with GEICO but declined it to maintain control over repair quality.

Exit Reasoning: The owner is motivated by the 'enormous amount of stress' involved in running the business. He states that with so many employees and moving parts, the company is becoming 'tougher and tougher to manage'. There also appears to be a generational difference, with the owner describing his father as 'old school' while he sees himself as 'more business savvy'. | Business History: The company was started by the owner's father in 1983 as a towing company with three employees. The owner joined nearly 19 years ago and has since grown the business, which now operates in Montgomery and Frederick counties in Maryland. It has expanded to include a collision center (Air Park Auto Body), a mechanical repair shop (Airport Towing and Auto repair), and holds a law enforcement towing contract since 1987. The owner also started a community-focused soccer complex for branding, and two years ago, launched a separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, to provide loaner cars for body shop customers.

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the owner's father. The owner and his father appear to be the primary operators, with the owner's brother also working at one of the locations. The business is described as a family operation. Boomerang Car Rentals is a separate LLC started by the owner.

Transaction Goals: The owner is not actively looking to sell but would consider a full sale of the main business if the right offer is presented, stating a preference to let someone else take over completely rather than sell a partial stake. He is open to considering an equity investor for the separate Boomerang Car Rentals business, which he believes has high growth potential. For the main company, he expressed a preference for debt-like financing over selling an equity position if he were to remain involved.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate approximately $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The company reports very little net income, around $10,000 to $20,000, due to a strategy of constant reinvestment into the business to minimize tax liability. The company has 48 employees and 18 tow trucks. The main auto body shop is 15,000 sq ft, with another 10,000 sq ft location in Frederick. A two-acre storage lot has a monthly rent of about $20,000. They do ADAS work in-house and use PPG paint.

M&A History: The owner mentioned that someone had recently reached out about a possible acquisition, which prompted this call. He stated that they have never seriously considered selling the business before this inquiry. They were once offered a DRP (Direct Repair Program) with GEICO but declined it.

Exit Reasoning: The primary motivation for considering a sale is the enormous stress and difficulty of managing a business of its current size with many employees. The owner mentioned that his father is 'old school' and the business has grown significantly, making it tougher to manage. The owner expressed a desire to be relieved of the operational burden. | Business History: The company was started by the owner's father in 1983 as a towing company. The son joined 19 years ago, and the business has grown to 48 employees. It operates across two Maryland counties and consists of several entities: a towing company with 18 trucks and a law enforcement contract since 1987; a collision center (Air Park Auto Body); a mechanical repair shop (Airport Towing and Auto Repair); a community-focused soccer complex for branding; and a separate rental car company called Boomerang Car Rentals, which was started two years ago and is tailored to serve body shop customers.

Ownership Details: The business was founded by the current operator's father. The owner and his father run the business, and the owner's brother also works at one of the shop locations. The father is described as 'old school.' The car rental business, Boomerang Car Rentals, is a separate LLC.

Transaction Goals: The owner's father is hesitant to sell but would consider the 'right offer.' The owner is interested in a full sale of the main company to alleviate management stress and would prefer to let a new owner take over completely rather than sell a partial equity stake. For the separate entity, Boomerang Car Rentals, the owner is open to selling an equity stake to an investor with capital for growth.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate about $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. Stated net income is very low, around $10,000 to $20,000, as profits are constantly reinvested into the business for assets like new trucks and to minimize the tax burden. No EBITDA was provided. The company has a two-acre storage lot with monthly rent of about $20,000. They do not participate in insurance DRPs, preferring to focus on quality or totaling vehicles to charge storage fees.

M&A History: Someone recently reached out to the company to discuss a possible acquisition, which prompted the current conversation. The owner stated that they had never previously thought about selling the business.

Exit Reasoning: The primary driver for considering a sale is the 'enormous amount of stress' involved in running the business. The owner finds it is 'becoming tougher and tougher to manage' due to the number of employees and overall complexity, and would prefer a full exit to hand off these operational challenges. | Business History: The company was started by the owner's father in 1983 as a towing company. The current owner joined 19 years ago and has helped grow the business to 48 employees across two counties in Maryland (Montgomery and Frederick). The business consists of a towing company with 18 trucks and a law enforcement contract since 1987, a collision center named Air Park Auto Body (15,000 sq ft), a separate mechanical shop called Airport Towing and Auto Repair, a two-acre towing and storage lot, and a community-focused soccer complex used for branding. Two years ago, the owner started a separate LLC, Boomerang Car Rentals, which has 30 cars and provides loaners to body shop customers.

Ownership Details: The business was started by the owner's father. The son, who is on the call, has been with the company for 19 years. The son's brother runs one of the shop locations. It is described as a family-run business, but specific ownership stakes or percentages are not mentioned.

Transaction Goals: The owner's father is reluctant to sell but would consider 'the right offer'. The owner is open to selling the entire company to alleviate the stress of running it and would prefer a full exit over selling a partial equity stake in the main business. However, for the separate car rental company, Boomerang Car Rentals, the owner is open to considering an investment or selling a stake in that specific entity.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate approximately $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The owner states the company shows very little net income, around $10,000 to $20,000, because profits are constantly reinvested into the business to purchase new equipment like trucks and to minimize tax obligations. The company pays about $20,000 per month in rent for its two-acre storage lot. The soccer complex is mentioned as not making money and is primarily for marketing purposes.

M&A History: The owner mentioned that someone had recently reached out about a possible acquisition, which prompted this call. Prior to this inbound inquiry, the owner stated they had 'never even thought for a second' about selling the business.

Exit Reasoning: The owner is exploring a sale due to the 'enormous amount of stress' involved in running the business and the increasing difficulty of managing its size and number of employees. The father is described as 'old school,' hinting at management challenges and a desire for a transition. | Business History:

1.2M Rev. Owner 73 y/o, 45 years in industry, son wants restorations not collision, only shop within 35-40 miles, State Farm DRP (75-80% of business)

one location.  12k sq ft, 1.5 acre lost.  8 employees, wants to retire, sell 100%. DRP w/State Farm. 
Business History: The business is a single-location collision center, Ultimate Collision Center Inc., which has been operating for 26 years. The owner has been in the collision industry for 45 years and started the current shop with his son. The shop is approximately 12,000 square feet and sits on about an acre and a half of property located on a major thoroughfare, Route 127. It is the only body shop within a 35-40 mile radius and serves a local population of 7,500 plus several surrounding towns. For 24 of its 26 years, it has been a State Farm DRP. The shop uses Exalta paint and is equipped with a Hunter alignment machine, a frame machine, and a spray booth. ADAS services are outsourced.
Ownership Details: The business is owned by the founder, who also owns the building and the lot the business operates on. His son, who helped him start the business, is an employee but is not mentioned as a partner or owner.
Transaction Goals: The owner is seeking to sell 100% of the business equity, as his son does not want to keep a piece of it and wishes to start a restoration business instead. The owner is flexible on the real estate and is open to either selling it with the business or leasing it to a buyer. The only debt mentioned is on the building, which was recently remodeled.
Financial info: The business generates annual revenue stated as 'Right at a million, two million, three,' indicating approximately $1.2 to $1.3 million.

Outsourced ADAS services are marked up by 25%.
M&A History: The owner had a prior conversation with an individual from California regarding a sale, but was not interested and did not get back to them due to a proposed 12% commission fee.
Exit Reasoning: The owner is 73 years old and is selling because he is ready to retire after 45 years in the business. A contributing factor is that his son does not want to take over the collision center and instead wants to pursue a career in vehicle restorations. The owner also expressed frustration with the difficulty of dealing with insurance companies. | Business History: The business is a single-location collision center established 26 years ago. The owner has been in the industry for 45 years. The shop is approximately 12,000 square feet and sits on a 1.5-acre property on Route 127, a major thoroughfare.
