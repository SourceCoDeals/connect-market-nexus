He is 73 years old and has been in the industry for 45 years. His son does not wish to continue in the collision business, preferring to open a car restoration shop. The owner also expressed significant frustration with dealing with insurance companies. Wants to sell 100%.;;https://app.fireflies.ai/view/Ultimate-Collision::01KCM8R94XTHWRDA481A5QE4A7;;;"
Business History: The business is a single-location collision center, Ultimate Collision Center Inc., which has been operating for 26 years. The owner has been in the collision industry for 45 years and started the current shop with his son. The shop is approximately 12,000 square feet and sits on about an acre and a half of property located on a major thoroughfare, Route 127. It is the only body shop within a 35-40 mile radius and serves a local population of 7,500 plus several surrounding towns. 

For 24 of its 26 years, it has been a State Farm DRP. The shop uses Exalta paint and is equipped with a Hunter alignment machine, a frame machine, and a spray booth. ADAS services are outsourced.

Ownership Details: The business is owned by the founder, who also owns the building and the lot the business operates on. His son, who helped him start the business, is an employee but is not mentioned as a partner or owner.

Transaction Goals: The owner is seeking to sell 100% of the business equity, as his son does not want to keep a piece of it and wishes to start a restoration business instead. The owner is flexible on the real estate and is open to either selling it with the business or leasing it to a buyer. The only debt mentioned is on the building, which was recently remodeled.

Financial info: The business generates annual revenue stated as 'Right at a million, two million, three,' indicating approximately $1.2 to $1.3 million. The owner believes it could generate $1.8 million annually if run more efficiently. The business has eight employees. When asked about earnings, the owner confirmed they are 'close to' the 15-20% range. Business from its State Farm DRP relationship constitutes 75-80% of revenue. Outsourced ADAS services are marked up by 25%.

The owner himself would prefer to sell the entire company rather than bring on an equity partner for the main business, stating he would rather let someone else take it over completely. For an investment, he would prefer a debt-like structure. However, he is open to considering an equity investment specifically for his separate LLC.

Exit Reasoning: The primary motivation for considering a sale is the 'enormous amount of stress' from running the business. The owner states the company has become 'tougher and tougher to manage' due to its size and number of employees. He also notes his father is 'old school', which may imply a difference in management style for a company of its current scale.""";;https://app.fireflies.ai/view/Airpark-Auto-Body::01KCPXF9RP9JV3FC207DHM4SF3;;;"Business Details: The business represents a diversified automotive services and logistics platform generating approximately $8–9 million in annual revenue across five integrated business units. The portfolio combines towing/logistics, collision repair, mechanical services, vehicle storage, and a car rental operation—creating significant operational synergies and customer lock-in.

Financial info: The combined businesses generate about $8 to $9 million in annual revenue. The company reports a low net income of approximately $10,000 to $20,000, which is attributed to a strategy of constantly reinvesting in the business (e.g., new trucks) and minimizing tax liability. The business does not participate in DRPs, instead focusing on high-quality repairs or totaling vehicles to charge insurance companies for storage on their two-acre lot, which costs about $20,000 per month in rent. They use PPG paint and perform ADAS work in-house, though they also outsource it when needed. A tax issue from 2020 recently caused a temporary financial setback but has been resolved.
