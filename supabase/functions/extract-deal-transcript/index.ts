# FIELD-BY-FIELD EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS

## SECTION 1: FINANCIALS

### Revenue (structured object)

Search the entire transcript for any mention of revenue, sales, top-line, gross revenue, annual revenue, run rate, or total sales. Apply these rules in order:

1. **Exact number stated:** "we do $8 million a year" → value=8000000, is_inferred=false.
2. **Range given:** "somewhere between 5 and 7 million" → use MIDPOINT (6000000). Include exact range in source_quote.
3. **Approximate/hedged language:** "about", "roughly", "around", "ballpark" with a single number → use that number.
4. **Inferred from other data:** "20% EBITDA margins on $1.2M EBITDA" → revenue ≈ $6M. OR "500 jobs/year at $15K average" → $7.5M. Set is_inferred=true, explain math in inference_method.
5. **Multiple revenue figures at different times:** "we did $5M last year but tracking to $7M this year" → use MOST CURRENT figure. Note historical in inference_method.
6. **Not mentioned:** value=null, source_quote=null.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Do NOT confuse revenue with EBITDA, profit, or cash flow.
- Do NOT confuse a single project value with annual revenue.
- Do NOT use enterprise value or asking price as revenue.
- "We bill about $600K a month" → ANNUALIZE to $7,200,000.
- Always store as a raw number with no dollar signs, commas, or abbreviations.

### EBITDA (structured object)

Search for EBITDA, earnings, cash flow, profit, margin, SDE, owner's benefit, adjusted earnings, or net income.

1. **EBITDA stated directly:** "our EBITDA is $1.5 million" → amount=1500000.
2. **Margin stated directly:** "we run at about 18% margins" → margin_percentage=18. If revenue known, calculate amount = revenue × (margin/100), set is_inferred=true.
3. **Margin calculable:** If both revenue and EBITDA stated, calculate margin_percentage = (EBITDA / revenue) × 100.
4. **SDE vs EBITDA:** If speaker says SDE/"seller's discretionary earnings"/"owner's benefit", use that number but note in financial_notes: "Figure represents SDE, not adjusted EBITDA. SDE includes owner compensation."
5. **Adjusted vs unadjusted:** Always prefer ADJUSTED figure. Note which was used in inference_method.
6. **Ranges/approximations:** Same as revenue — midpoint for ranges.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Do NOT confuse gross margin with EBITDA margin.
- Do NOT use revenue as EBITDA.
- "We keep about 20 cents on every dollar" → margin_percentage=20.
- "After I pay myself $300K, the business throws off another $800K" — this is likely SDE territory. Flag it.

### Financial Notes (string — detailed paragraph, 3-5 sentences MINIMUM)

Scan the ENTIRE transcript for financial context beyond revenue/EBITDA. This field is CRITICAL for buyer due diligence. Include ALL of the following if mentioned:
- **Revenue trends:** "Revenue grown 15% YoY for 3 years", "down year in 2023", "tracking to $X this year". Include MULTIPLE years if discussed.
- **Pending changes:** "Just signed $2M contract starting next quarter", "about to lose biggest customer"
- **Tax structure:** S-corp, C-corp, LLC, sole proprietor — how taxes affect reported earnings
- **Working capital needs:** AR/AP cycles, inventory requirements, payment terms
- **One-time items:** "$500K insurance claim inflated last year", "bought new fleet — unusual capex"

If NOTHING beyond revenue/EBITDA mentioned: "No additional financial context provided in this call."

### Add-Backs (string — detailed paragraph)

This is CRITICAL for deal valuation. Extract EVERY mention of owner compensation and adjustable expenses:
1. **Owner/officer compensation:** Base salary, bonuses, car allowance, health insurance, retirement contributions, country club, personal travel. "I pay myself $250K plus car and health insurance" — capture EXACT figures.
2. **Family on payroll:** Spouse, children, relatives employed. "My wife handles the books part-time but she's on payroll for $80K" — flag whether they perform legitimate work.
3. **Personal expenses through business:** Meals, entertainment, vehicles, home office, personal travel billed to company.
4. **Above-market rent:** "I own the building and charge the company $12K/month" — note market rate vs charged rate if discussed.
5. **One-time expenses:** Litigation, equipment write-offs, COVID impacts, startup costs for new service lines.
6. **Discretionary expenses:** Charitable donations, sponsorships, marketing that new owner could cut.
Include DOLLAR AMOUNTS wherever the owner gives them. This data directly affects EBITDA normalization.
If not discussed, set to null.

### Debt Details (string — detailed paragraph)

Extract ALL mentions of business debt and financial obligations:
1. **Loan types:** SBA loans, equipment financing, vehicle loans, lines of credit, term loans, real estate loans, merchant cash advances.
2. **Amounts:** Current balance, original amount, monthly payment. "We owe about $500K on the SBA loan."
3. **Terms:** Interest rate, remaining years, maturity date, balloon payment.
4. **Covenant restrictions:** Any operational constraints from lenders.
5. **Personal guarantees:** Owner's personal guarantee on business debt.
6. **Lines of credit:** Available credit, current draw, terms.
If not discussed, set to null.

### Capex Details (string — detailed paragraph)

Extract ALL capital expenditure and equipment information:
1. **Recent investments:** "Just bought $500K in new trucks", "Invested $200K in the textile facility last year"
2. **Deferred maintenance:** Equipment that needs replacing, buildings needing repair.
3. **Fleet details:** Number and age of vehicles, replacement cycle, fleet value.
4. **Equipment condition:** "Our equipment is all less than 5 years old" vs "Some machines are 20 years old."
5. **Planned purchases:** Near-term capex needs that a buyer would inherit.
6. **Annual capex run rate:** "We spend about $100K a year on equipment."
If not discussed, set to null.

### Recurring Revenue Percentage (number or null)

What percentage of revenue is recurring, contracted, or subscription-based vs one-time/project-based?
- "About 60% of our work is recurring maintenance contracts" → 60
- "Most of our revenue comes from insurance referrals that repeat" → estimate based on context
- "It's mostly project-based, one-off jobs" → 10-20 range based on context
- Only capture if discussed. Do NOT guess without evidence.
Store as integer (60 not 0.60).

### Seasonality Details (string or null)

Detailed seasonal revenue and operational patterns:
- Which months/quarters are strongest and weakest: "Q2-Q3 is 70% of our revenue"
- How seasonality affects staffing: "We hire 15 temps in summer, lay off in winter"
- Cash flow timing: "Collections slow in Q4"
- How owner manages: "We do commercial work in winter to fill the gap"
If not discussed, set to null.

## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (string — 5-12 sentences)

This is the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT field. It must be a comprehensive, investor-ready overview that covers everything a PE buyer needs to evaluate the opportunity at a glance. This field replaces separate "business model" and "competitive position" fields, so it MUST weave those themes in.

Write a summary a PE investor could scan in 60 seconds. MUST include ALL of the following that are available:
1. **What the company does and HOW it makes money** — primary services/products, business model (B2B vs B2C vs mixed, recurring vs project-based, subscription vs contract vs transactional), revenue model, and how services interrelate.
2. **Size indicators** — revenue, EBITDA, margins, employee count (use whichever are available). Be precise with numbers.
3. **Geographic presence** — where they operate, HQ location, number of locations, service radius, states covered.
4. **Competitive advantages and market position** — certifications, preferred vendor relationships, proprietary processes, customer lock-in mechanisms, brand reputation, years in market, franchise affiliations, awards, barriers to entry. What makes this company hard to replicate?
5. **Customer base quality** — type of customers (residential, commercial, government, insurance), recurring/repeat rates, contract vs spot work, key account relationships.
6. **Growth trajectory** — how fast they've grown AND where they could go with investment. Specific levers: geographic expansion, new services, acquisitions, sales team, commercial push.
7. **Acquisition attractiveness** — platform opportunity? strong add-on? geographic gap filler? What's the thesis?
8. **Owner goals and transaction motivation (1-2 sentences, IF available)** — why the owner wants to sell or partner, what they're looking for in a deal (retirement, growth capital, partial liquidity, health reasons, partner buyout, etc.). Only include if the transcript contains this information; omit entirely if not discussed.

**Style rules:**
- Write in third person ("The company..." not "They...").
- Use SPECIFIC numbers from the transcript, not vague language.
- Do NOT include risks in executive summary — those go in other fields.
- Lead with the most compelling aspect.
- The business overview (points 1-7) should be 5-10 sentences depending on the level of detail available in the transcript.
- Owner goals (point 8) should be 1-2 sentences appended at the end, only if discussed in the transcript.
- Every sentence should contain at least one SPECIFIC fact, number, or detail.
- This is NOT a brief tagline — it's a full investment summary.

**Example:** "ABC Restoration is a $8.2M revenue fire and water restoration company based in Sellersburg, IN, operating across southern Indiana and the Louisville metro area with 45 full-time staff across two locations. The company generates approximately $1.5M in adjusted EBITDA (18% margins) through a diversified service model spanning fire restoration (~40%), water restoration (~35%), and a growing roofing segment (~25%), with approximately 60% residential and 40% commercial mix. Revenue is driven by a combination of insurance-referred restoration projects (recurring via DRP partnerships with State Farm, Allstate, and USAA) and direct-to-consumer retail work, creating a resilient demand profile. The company holds IICRC certifications, maintains preferred vendor status with three major insurance carriers, and has built an 18-year track record and strong regional reputation that creates significant barriers to entry for competitors. Founded in 2005, the business has grown from $2M to $8.2M over five years, with recent expansion into commercial roofing opening a substantial new revenue stream. This represents an attractive platform opportunity in the fragmented $70B restoration services market, with clear organic growth levers (geographic expansion into Kentucky, commercial segment growth) and add-on acquisition potential (two smaller competitors identified as targets). The owner is seeking a full exit within the next 12-18 months, primarily motivated by retirement after 20 years of ownership, and is open to a transition period of up to one year to ensure continuity of key insurance carrier relationships."

## SECTION 3: SERVICES

### Services (array of strings)

List EVERY distinct service/product mentioned ANYWHERE in the transcript — not just the "what do you do" section. Owners reveal additional services casually later.
- Listen for direct statements: "We do X, Y, and Z."
- Listen for indirect mentions: "We also started doing roofing about two years ago"
- Listen for sub-services: If "restoration" → does that mean fire, water, mold, storm, smoke, or all?
- Listen for ancillary services: "We have our own textile cleaning facility"
- Mark planned services: "commercial HVAC (planned)"
- Use lowercase except proper nouns. Be specific: "fire restoration" not "restoration".
- Include sub-services as SEPARATE items: ["fire restoration", "water restoration", "mold remediation"] NOT ["restoration"]

### Service Mix (string — detailed paragraph)

1. **Primary services with revenue percentages** if owner gave them: "Fire restoration ~40%, water restoration ~35%"
2. **How services interrelate:** "Water damage calls frequently lead to mold remediation, creating natural cross-sell"
3. **Residential vs commercial split** if mentioned
4. **Recurring vs project-based split** if mentioned
5. **In-house vs subcontracted** for each service
6. **Recently added or planned services**
If owner didn't provide percentage breakdowns, say so explicitly. Do NOT make up percentages.

## SECTION 4: GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE

Use SPECIFIC NUMBERS. Do not generalize.

## SECTION 8: COMPANY BASICS

If not discussed in detail, capture whatever WAS discussed. Set to null only if workforce is completely unmentioned.

### Management Team (string — detailed paragraph, 2-4 sentences)

Extract details about the management layer BELOW the owner. This is CRITICAL for succession risk assessment:
1. **Key personnel:** Name, title, tenure, responsibilities. "My ops manager John has been here 12 years, he runs everything day-to-day."
2. **The #2 person:** Is there someone who could take over if the owner left? "If I stepped away, Sarah could keep it running."
3. **Bench strength:** How deep is the team? "I have 3 project managers who each handle their own book."
4. **Owner dependence:** How involved is the owner? "I still sell 80% of the work" vs "I'm mostly just overseeing."
5. **Recent hires:** Did they recently bring in management talent? "Just hired a GM last year to take over operations."
6. **Gaps:** What roles are missing? "We need a proper CFO" or "No dedicated sales person."
If not discussed: "Management team structure not discussed on this call. Recommend follow-up to assess succession readiness."

### Competitive Advantages (string — detailed paragraph, 3-5 sentences)

Extract EVERY competitive differentiator and barrier to entry discussed:
1. **Certifications and designations:** IICRC, ISO, EPA, preferred vendor status, franchise affiliations, contractor licenses. "We're one of only 3 certified Xactimate shops in the state."
2. **Customer lock-in:** Long-term contracts, switching costs, DRP (direct repair program) relationships, exclusive arrangements. "We're on State Farm's preferred vendor list — that took 5 years to get."
3. **Proprietary processes:** Unique methodologies, custom software, patents, trade secrets. "We built our own dispatch system."

## SECTION 11: KEY QUOTES (8-10 EXACT VERBATIM)

Select the 8-10 most revealing quotes — the "highlights reel" a buyer scans to understand the opportunity.
Priority order:
1. **Financial specifics:** "We did $8.2 million last year with about $1.5 million in EBITDA."
2. **Growth statements:** "I honestly think this could be a $15 million business with the right investment."
3. **Owner motivation:** "I'm 62 and I've been doing this for 30 years. I want to enjoy my grandkids."
4. **Competitive advantages:** "We're the only company in the region that handles fire, water, AND roofing in-house."
5. **Risk revelations:** "If I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I'm honestly not sure the business could run without me."
6. **Customer insights:** "State Farm sends us probably 60% of our work."
7. **Operational details:** "We just invested $500K in a new textile cleaning facility."
8. **Deal preferences:** "I'm not looking for a full buyout — I want a partner who can bring capital and expertise."

**Rules:**
- MUST be exact verbatim quotes — NOT paraphrased
- Include enough context that quote makes sense standalone (2-3 sentences OK)
- Do NOT include small talk, pleasantries, or filler
- Do NOT include quotes from the interviewer — only from the business owner/seller

---

## GLOBAL RULES (apply to ALL fields):

1. **Search the ENTIRE transcript.** A question about employees might prompt a revenue disclosure. A question about customers might reveal geography.
2. **Use exact quotes for source_quote fields.** Copy-paste exact words. Do not paraphrase.
3. **When data conflicts, use the most specific and most recent statement.** "$7M" early → "$7.2M" later when more precise → use $7.2M.
4. **When data is missing, say so explicitly.** Never fabricate. Use null for structured fields, "Not discussed on this call" for text fields.
5. **Flag inconsistencies.** Owner says 45 employees but describes only 3 crews of 3 → note discrepancy.
6. **Numbers as raw integers.** 8000000 not "$8M" or "8,000,000".
7. **Percentages as numbers.** 18 not "18%" or 0.18. (margin_percentage=18 means 18%)
8. **State codes: 2-letter uppercase.** "IN" not "Indiana".
9. **Don't over-extract.** Jokes or hypotheticals are not data points.
10. **Prioritize accuracy over completeness.** Null is better than wrong. Wrong data causes bad buyer matches.

IMPORTANT: Populate as MANY fields as possible with MAXIMUM DETAIL. Use the extract_deal_info tool to return structured data.`;

    const systemPrompt = `You are a senior M&A analyst at an investment bank conducting due diligence on lower-middle-market acquisition targets (typically $500K–$10M EBITDA businesses). Your job is to extract EVERY piece of structured data from this call transcript.

CORE RULES:

1. EXHAUSTIVE EXTRACTION: Read the ENTIRE transcript from start to finish. Owners reveal critical info throughout, not just when directly asked.
2. ACCURACY OVER COMPLETENESS: It is better to return null than to return wrong data.
3. NUMBERS AS RAW INTEGERS: All dollar amounts must be stored as raw numbers. "$7.5M" = 7500000.
4. PERCENTAGES AS INTEGERS: margin_percentage=18 means 18%. NOT 0.18.
5. STATE CODES: Always 2-letter uppercase. "IN" not "Indiana."
6. VERBATIM QUOTES: source_quote and key_quotes must be EXACT words from the transcript.
7. CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Use the MOST SPECIFIC and MOST RECENT statement.
8. FLAG INCONSISTENCIES in financial_notes or follow-up questions.
9. DO NOT OVER-EXTRACT jokes or hypotheticals.
10. IGNORE THE INTERVIEWER: Extract data from the business owner/seller only.

DEPTH REQUIREMENTS — Every text field should be DETAILED with MAXIMUM CONTEXT. Think of each field as a mini-section of an investment memo:
- executive_summary: 5-12 sentences — this is the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT field. 5-10 sentences covering what the company does, business model (how it makes money), size indicators, geography, competitive advantages (certifications, preferred vendor status, proprietary processes, market position), customer base quality, growth trajectory, and acquisition attractiveness. Then 1-2 sentences on owner goals and why they want to transact (only if discussed in transcript). Write like a PE investor memo. Every sentence must contain specific facts or numbers.
- financial_notes: 3-5 sentences covering revenue trends over time, tax structure, working capital needs, pending changes. Focus on TRENDS and CONTEXT — the add_backs, debt_details, capex_details, and seasonality_details fields handle the rest.
- add_backs: 2-4 sentences — CRITICAL for valuation. Owner compensation (salary + perks + benefits), family on payroll, personal expenses through business, above-market rent to related entity, one-time items. Include DOLLAR AMOUNTS.
- debt_details: 2-3 sentences — loan types (SBA, equipment, LOC), amounts, monthly payments, terms, personal guarantees.
- capex_details: 2-3 sentences — recent investments, deferred maintenance, fleet details, annual capex run rate, equipment age/condition.
- seasonality_details: 1-3 sentences — strongest/weakest quarters, % revenue by season, staffing impact.
- workforce_details: 3-5 sentences — functional breakdown (field vs office vs sales vs management), tenure/retention, compensation structure (hourly/salary, W-2/1099, benefits), certifications held, key person dependencies, hiring challenges.
- management_team: 2-4 sentences — key personnel below owner (name, title, tenure, what they handle), who is the #2, bench strength, owner's day-to-day involvement level.
- competitive_advantages: 3-5 sentences — certifications/designations, customer lock-in (DRP, contracts, switching costs), proprietary processes, scale advantages, reputation/brand, regulatory moats, key relationships that took years to build. This is what makes the company HARD TO REPLICATE.
- service_mix: 2-4 sentences with revenue percentages if stated, residential vs commercial split, recurring vs project-based, how services interrelate, in-house vs subcontracted.
- owner_goals: 2-4 sentences with primary motivation, desired deal type, financial expectations, beyond-money goals, urgency signals. Include owner's exact words.
- transition_preferences: 2-3 sentences covering duration, role, willing vs not willing, key relationships held, training plan, non-compete.
- growth_trajectory: 2-3 sentences with specific numbers — revenue growth rates, new locations, new services, hiring, contract wins, expansion plans. Split into HISTORICAL (what has happened) and FUTURE POTENTIAL (what could happen with investment).
- customer_types: 2-3 sentences covering specific segments, concentration details, key accounts, repeat rates, contract vs spot work.
- key_risks: 2-4 sentences — key person risk, customer concentration, regulatory, market, operational, financial, legal, succession. Be BALANCED — include negatives.
- key_quotes: 8-10 VERBATIM quotes from the owner, prioritized by financial specifics, growth statements, motivation, competitive advantages, risk revelations.
