-- ============================================================================
-- Deal → Marketplace Listing Financial Sync
-- ============================================================================
-- Enforces the rule: deals are the source of truth for financial data.
-- When a deal's financials are updated, all marketplace listings created
-- from that deal (via source_deal_id) are automatically kept in sync.
--
-- This prevents data drift where a deal shows $5M revenue but its
-- marketplace listing still shows the $3M that was copied at creation time.
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Trigger function: propagate financial changes from deal to marketplace listing(s)
